### **Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene   regulation in immune-mediated diseases**

+++

#### Background：

1. We lacking understanding about the responsible ==genes== or relevant ==cell types== in IMDs
2. The majority of variants in IMDs lie in non-coding regions，and we analyze ==eQTL== to find their effects

#### **Research** ：

1. Construct  a database: gene expression and genome sequencing data (IMD patients- immune cells) "ImmuNexUT’’ 
2. Identify immune cell type-specific eQTLs
3. links GWAS variants to susceptible genes, cell types, and environment

#### ==**Thinking**:==

+ **Database**: Construct database and demonstrate it's useful for the study of IMDs

1.  ==Construct datasets: 416 donors(9852 samples，28 distinct immune cells)== ← Need to be proven useful(Hierarchical clustering )

   > 79 healthy donors
   >
   > 337 IMD patients
   >
   > >autoimmune diseases (SLE, MCTD, SSc, SjS, IIM, and RA) 
   > >
   > >autoinflammatory diseases(BD and AOSD)

2. We found that some genes were especially dysregulated in specific diseases → indicate it‘s useful →investigate pathogenesis of IMDs

3. Compare with other datasets(Japaneses and Europeans) to evaluate the validity

4. Combine our database ==with databases from Europe==(GTEx v8) can improve accuracy

+ **eQTL analysis**: 

1. we found immune cell-type specificity eQTL:

   > Compare with DICE, we can detect genes with smaller effect sizes in our datasets( *ImmuNexUT*)
   >
   > Low effect size eQTLs overlapped with enhancers 
   >
   > We ==confirmed the cell-type specificity== of eQTL effects by using eQTL analysis and ATAC-seq

2. We found that eQTL analysis in immune cells can be influenced ==by external stimuli==, and it helps to identify stimulation-dependent eQTLs under physiologic conditions

3.  we analyzed the interaction of eQTL effect size and genome-wide gene expression

   > the Genes interacted with eQTL effects, showed larger variation among IMDs
   >
   > context-dependent eQTLs may play a role in individual differences in immune response

+ **GWAS and eQTL analysis**: 

1. We associated eQTLs with GWAS results to links variants to susceptible genes, cell types, and environment

#### Comment：

1. Construct a larger database consists of 28 distinct immune cell subsets. and For any database we need to verify it’s validity and usefulness，We can compare with previous studies
2. We have to consider the limitations of the sample，a large proportion of donors in this database consist of female subjects. Also，we need to consider differences in race, gender and so on
3. This study indicate the immune cell type-specific eQTLs，and found the features，which may  play a role in the  Immune disease research
4.  Associating eQTLs with GWAS may give us more information
